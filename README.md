## Project Description 

Periapical radiographies are x-rays images that show full teeth: from the root to the crown.

In this project we will try to discern a healthy tooth from and unhealthy one, by applying CNN and image processing techniques to classify x-rays (focusing on the root), a task that has been proven to be difficult even for seasoned odontologists.

## Goal

Our goal is to design an algorithm that could help on identifing unhealthy roots, and thus be able to help a profesional odontologist to make choices easily.


## Dataset

Dataset is obtained from real individuals, although no more information can be disclosed due to LOPD laws.

The dataset contains 300 x-ray radiographies: 150 healthy, 150 unhealthy teeth.
Additional categorical information such as age and sex is provided partialy.
 
* If the question cannot be answered with the available data, why not? What data would you need to answer it better? PENDING 

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.

- Manually extracting sex and age information from the images themself
- Erasing private information from images using OpenCV library

## Analysis
 PENDING
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation

PENDING
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

## Conclusion
PENDING
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
PENDING
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
PENDING
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?

## Organization
PENDING
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
PENDING
Include links to your repository, slides and trello/kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
